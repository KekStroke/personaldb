About Neural Networks .
. collection of small computing units called neurons that take 
  incoming data and learn to make decision over time.
. become more efficient as data sets increase in volume (other 
  machine learning algorithms may plateau as data increases).
. computer scientists attempt to mimic biological neurons to process 
  information.
. we abandoned some time ago since they are computationally very 
  expensive.
